  #schedule:
    # The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.
    # Note: The schedule event can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions workflow runs. 
    # High load times include the start of every hour. 
    # To decrease the chance of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a different time of the hour.
    # Every 5 minutes.

    # At the beginning of every day.
